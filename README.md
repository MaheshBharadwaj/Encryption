# Encryption
Program that emulates end to end encryption by using dynamic running key cipher

Note:
    Always decrypt immediately after encrypting as the key changes for each instance of the program
    
Note2:
    [in code blocks] You are required to link libcomdlg32.a before compilation. This is done by:
     settings->compiler settings->linker settings->add->[your codeblocks directory]->mingw->lib and locating the said file
     #this has been tested only in windows#
